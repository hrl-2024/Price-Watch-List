The reason I'm only giving it four stars instead of five is because you have to be really careful of the tiny screw that attaches the cold shoe mount to the rest of the unit (at the very bottom of unit). After multiple uses I've had that tiny screw loosen and fall out which renders the shockmount completely useless if you lose that tiny screw.",

The shock mount is essential for some video equipment, because the included microphone mounts with some models may not be tall enough to prevent an optional wind sock or muff to be seen in the field of view of the recording equipment. That was the problem I had with the Canon xa-11 microphone mount included with the camcorder. But the Auray universal shock mount was the perfect solution and pairs with the rode line of microphones beautifully. It also helps reduce unwanted noise from bumps or any vigorous activity while filming. Great product that's simple but useful in many film applications.",

It’s compact, durable, it tightens up on the swivel really well and it has a cold shoe that allows you to also attach It to a camera, which I’ve done a few times and it’s great. My favorite feature, though, has to be how the mic slips in and out but still grips the mic tightly when in use. As pro voice over and audio tech, I switch out mics frequently and this works as well as it did when I got it a year ago. It’s the only shotgun shockmount I recommend to my students and clients.
