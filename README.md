### Networking
- [Add list of network requests by screen ]
- [Create basic snippets for each Parse network request]
- [OPTIONAL: List endpoints if using existing API such as Yelp]


Outline Parse Network Requests: <br>
Because of the nature of our app, we don't really need any  backend management. All we need is to use the existing API (Rainforest) to search for a product and grab the price, and all other network request listed below.

* Main Screen
    * No networking request needed
* Search-result Screen
    * (Search/Display) Search for the item user typed in and display them out
    * (Read/GET) Using the Rainforest API to get the item user searched for and parse the data from the .JSON returned
* Item Page
    * (Read/GET) Get the item URL first from the Search-result screen
    * (Read/GET) From the URL, make another request to Rainforest API to get the item detail JSON file and parse it (product name, image, price, rating, or anything we decide later to include)
* Watch list
    * (Create)
        * create a table cell for the product user added to their watch list
        * can be done locally by using UserDefault
    * (Delete) 
        * remove the table cell
        * ask for help on how to remove items during breakout session
    * (Read/Get)
        * grab the URL of the product from UserDefault and use Rainforest API to grab the image and the current price of the product
* Log-in Page (Optional Feature)
